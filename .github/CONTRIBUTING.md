# Contributing to AzAd

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AzAd as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the project's style
5. Issue a pull request

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with notes on your changes
3. Increase the version numbers following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting
