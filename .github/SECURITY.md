## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any AzAd project, please report it by emailing ayyaz@azad.co instead of using the issue tracker.

Please include:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Suggested fix (if any)

We will investigate and respond as quickly as possible. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.
